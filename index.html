            <br />
            <p>
                Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but
                you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I
                don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this
                case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too
                much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb
                ass.
            </p>

                Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's
                called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows,
                and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to
                make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television
                programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones
                that became nothing.
