                      Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but
                      you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I
                      don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this
                      case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too
                      much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb
                      ass.

            <br />
            <p>I love tacos more than your average cat. If you find your tummy grumbling and realize that you’re
                fiending for some tacos anytime of the day or night, all you need to do is pet me by pushing the button
                below! I’ll crawl all over your city to find the taco restaurants nearest to you!</p><br>

            <p>I’m not the neatest with presenting all of my hard work right now. It’s really hard to write when you
                don’t have opposable thumbs! Feel free to give me and my development team suggestions on how I can
                improve!</p>
